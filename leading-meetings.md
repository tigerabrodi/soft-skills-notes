# Agenda

To lead a meeting effectively, you need an Agenda, a plan for the meeting. The agenda should be shared with the participants before the meeting. It should include the purpose of the meeting, the topics to be discussed, and the expected outcomes.

# Before the Meeting: Setting up for Success

- Invite the right people.
- Make sure they know why they are there.
- Ask them to come prepared.

# During the Meeting: Leading it effectively

- Start on time.
- Start by aligning everyone on the purpose of the meeting and the expected outcomes, let them ask questions if they have any.
- Keep everyone on track. For example, "For time purposes, I'd like to bring us back to the topic at hand."
- Make sure everyone feels heard
  - Ask people who haven't spoken for their opinion.
  - Pause points
  - Dive deeper into someone's point

# After the Meeting: Effective follow-up

- Take notes throughout the meeting.
- Summarize the meeting and send it to the participants as a follow-up.
- Call out action items and assign them to people.
